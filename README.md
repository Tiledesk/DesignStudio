 Tiledesk Design Studio

Tiledesk is an open-source, no-code development platform for creating chatbots and conversational apps. Our Design Studio, featured in this repository, offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface with pre-ready actions and integrations. This platform combines the power of LLM/GPT AI with a flexible 'graph' approach for creating conversations and automations with ease.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Main Features

- **Pre-Designed Conversations and Admin Task Automation:** Automate customer conversations and daily administrative tasks.
- **Prototype Conversations:** Use our drag-and-drop conversation builder to design your chatbotâ€™s conversation flow.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Understand urgent situations and take appropriate actions, such as offering to connect the customer with a human agent.
- **ChatGPT Powered Chatbot:** Find answers in the knowledge base and respond to customer inquiries in a human-like dialogue.
- **Enhancing User Experience:** Share images, GIFs, and videos in chats to make the conversation more engaging.
- **Personalized Product Recommendations:** Show personalized product recommendations based on previous conversations or customer interests.
- **Conditions:** Set conditions for different scenarios.
- **Random Reply:** Write different messages, and for each iteration, the bot randomly uses one of them.
- **Web Request:** Connect your bot to other tools, for example, HubSpot CRM. After each conversation, save all customer contact info to your HubSpot CRM.
- **WhatsApp Integration:** Convert website conversations into WhatsApp chats.
- **Send Email:** Send emails from your platform and set up email triggers that send emails automatically.
- **Light Integration:** Enhance your existing setup with our seamless and non-disruptive integration feature. Experience an upgrade without upheaval.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
